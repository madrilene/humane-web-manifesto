We need a better web.

The web is becoming more and more hostile to humans. Users are tracked relentlessly and their privacy routinely violated. Search results are populated with ads. We are constantly spammed by bots. Generative AI threatens to turn previously useful public forums into soulless marketing soup, while sacrificing the livelihoods of the creators that unwittingly power them.
