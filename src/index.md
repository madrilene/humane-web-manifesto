title: Manifesto for a Humane Web
---

The web is becoming hostile to humans. Users are tracked and their privacy is routinely violated. Search results are populated with ads. We are constantly spammed by bots. Generative AI threatens to turn previously useful public forums into soulless marketing soup, while sacrificing the livelihoods of the creators that unwittingly power them [<sup>1</sup>](#ref_1). Power-hungry data centres[<sup>2</sup>](#ref_2) demand the burning of fossil fuels, and divert water and energy from communities, emitting tonnes of carbon in order to power this digital junkyard. Users abandon hostile websites that take too long to load on low-powered devices, or are forced to upgrade, as the pile of electronic waste grows[<sup>3</sup>](#ref_3).

We need a web **by and for humans**.
