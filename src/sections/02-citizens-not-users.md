title: Citizens, not users
---

In writing this manifesto, I thought a lot about how we refer to people accessing the web as “users”. The term “users” implies a group distinct from those building and creating for the web. To me it implies a more passive relationship of consuming content. In reality, we should all have the opportunity to create, publish, build and consume content on the web. Like a functioning society, we take what we need, and we contribute what we can. We are citizens of the web.

The term “Netizen” was coined by Michael Hauber[<sup>5</sup>](#ref_5) to describe someone who actively contributes to the development of the web, as opposed to someone who goes online only to consume content. I would argue we are all Netizens now. Even when we go online to read the news, or find a recipe, it is virtually impossible to prevent our data being harvested and used to mould our browsing experience. We **all** shape the web of today, whether or not by choice. Just as opting out of society is virtually impossible, in the world of today we cannot help but be Netizens. Therefore we all have a duty of care and respect, and we all have a stake in a humane web. In this manifesto I have tried to avoid using the term “users” when referring to people accessing the web.
