A humane web should be:

### Accessible

Our websites should meet people where they are. They should be accessible to all, regardless of race, gender, age, ability, or economic status.

### Inclusive

Our websites should not discriminate against groups of users, and gatekeeping should be avoided.

### Safe

Our websites should not put people in danger. They should not serve harmful content, or content that encourages harm, violence or discrimination against others, nor should they should not support enablers of harm.

### Secure

Our websites should protect people’s privacy. They should respect data protection laws. We should afford visitors the confidence that their data will not be sold to third parties without their explicit knowledge and consent.

### Sustainable

Every care should be taken to minimise our websites’ environmental impact. They should be clean, efficient, and avoid encouraging waste.

### Reliable

Information provided on the web should be trustworthy.

### Resilient

Services should function in their time of need. Users should not be excluded from vital services due to technical limitations (e.g. low-powered devices, poor connections).

### Open and transparent

The motivations and intent of a website should be made clear to users, and allow open exchange of information.

### Independent

No one “owns” the web. No single central authority decides who can publish on or access the web.

### Human-centred

Our websites should be designed by and for humans. They should be kind, collaborative, and foster connections, not isolation. A humane web should contribute to a better future.
