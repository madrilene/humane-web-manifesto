title: 'About the manifesto'
---

This manifesto is intended as a personal response to the current state of the web. It is a statement of intent and a call to arms, inviting you, the reader, to go forth and build humane websites, and to resist the degradation of the web we know and love. It reflects my thoughts and feelings at the time of writing, but it is not “complete”. The definition of a humane web should grow and evolve over time.

### Citizens, not users

In writing this manifesto, I thought a lot about how we refer to people accessing the web as “users”. The term “users” implies a group distinct from those building and creating for the web. To me it implies a more passive relationship of consuming content. In reality, we should all have the opportunity to create, publish, build and consume content on the web. Like a functioning society, we take what we need, and we contribute what we can. We are citizens of the web.

The term “Netizen” was coined by Michael Hauber to describe someone who actively contributes to the development of the web, as opposed to someone who goes online only to consume content. I would argue we are all Netizens now. Even when we go online to read the news, or find a recipe, it is virtually impossible to prevent our data being harvested and used to shape the browsing experience we encounter. We **all** shape the web of today, whether or not by choice. Just as opting out of society is virtually impossible, in the world of today we cannot help but be Netizens. Therefore we all have a duty of care and respect, and we all have a stake in a humane web. I have tried to avoid using the term “users” when referring to people accessing the web.
